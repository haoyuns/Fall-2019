> Edward Tufte: “For a wide range of problems in data presentation, small multiples are the best design solution.”

#### Small multiples:
A method for displaying several charts, diagrams or pictures
- in a consistent manner
- at a small size
- in a grid layout

#### Why?

1. We want our readers to spend their time and attention absorbing our findings, not deciphering our chart legends.

Small multiples can speed the interpretation of the graphic because there is no legend to decode.

2. Communicating findings is that it allows a designer to neatly arrange a large amount of information in a small space.

In other words, small multiples allow for comparisons. The more information in each panel, and the better organized it is, the more comparisons can be made.

So it is with small multiples: They’re powerful tools for comparison because they put a lot of information side-by-side.

#### How?

1. Titles and labels

Small multiples contain many possible takeaways, and titles clarify for the reader which ones we’re most trying to communicate. Without titles to guide them, readers might still take away something from a particular display, but it might not be something accurate or meaningful.

2. Common style, scales and references

We typically use the same color, type style and axis ranges — in other words, a template. Ideally, the only thing that should change is the data.

3. Panel order

an ordered display can make findings more noticeable.

Ordering panels by some value often results in a repeating pattern that changes slightly from panel to panel, almost like an animation. In this way, panel order helps give the reader a narrative to follow — a beginning, middle and end.
