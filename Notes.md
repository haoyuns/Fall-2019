> Edward Tufte: “For a wide range of problems in data presentation, small multiples are the best design solution.”

#### Small multiples:
A method for displaying several charts, diagrams or pictures
- in a consistent manner
- at a small size
- in a grid layout

#### Why?

1. We want our readers to spend their time and attention absorbing our findings, not deciphering our chart legends.

Small multiples can speed the interpretation of the graphic because there is no legend to decode.

2. Communicating findings is that it allows a designer to neatly arrange a large amount of information in a small space.

In other words, small multiples allow for comparisons. The more information in each panel, and the better organized it is, the more comparisons can be made.

So it is with small multiples: They’re powerful tools for comparison because they put a lot of information side-by-side.

#### How?

1. Titles and labels

Small multiples contain many possible takeaways, and titles clarify for the reader which ones we’re most trying to communicate. Without titles to guide them, readers might still take away something from a particular display, but it might not be something accurate or meaningful.

2. Common style, scales and references

We typically use the same color, type style and axis ranges — in other words, a template. Ideally, the only thing that should change is the data.

3. Panel order

an ordered display can make findings more noticeable.

Ordering panels by some value often results in a repeating pattern that changes slightly from panel to panel, almost like an animation. In this way, panel order helps give the reader a narrative to follow — a beginning, middle and end.

#### Judges’ expectations

For storytelling: presenting the information with coherence and continuity, with clear organization and a concise “so what” message.

#### Self reflection
> There aren’t any well-defined characters.
> There isn’t a plot with impactful events.
> You can carve out a “beginning,” a “middle,” and an “end,” but those would at best be arbitrary divisions based on logic, not a rise to a climax and a fall to a resolution.

“Storytelling” is often used as a blanket statement to describe how well the information is presented in an interpretable presentation with a logical flow.

Visualizations that weave emotional narratives as beautifully as a written short story.

Well-defined characters.

Individuals with discernible personalities and emotions, who experience and react to relatively climactic events.

> I spend my time zoomed out to the county level, aggregating hundreds or thousands of people and events into a single data point.
> These “characters” lack names or personalities and, as I’ve described them, autonomy.

#### Data humanism
It’s really hard to tell a powerful story in aggregate when all of the humans and all of their lives and moments and emotions are plotted under a single data point, often represented through a behavioral variable, e.g. “sales”, or “likes”. In aggregate, we lose all the parts and pieces that make characters relatable and memorable.

Today, “story” and “narrative” are used less to describe the craft and more to reference coherent flows placed within the necessary context to deliver meaning.

> I realize that my take here is swimming against larger cultural trends, and perhaps my creative writing background has turned me into too much of a purist.

John Schwabish: 

> Even though we often say we’re telling data stories, with those kinds of charts we are not telling stories, but instead making a point or elucidating an argument.

Cole Nussbaumer:

> A good story grabs your attention and takes you on a journey, evoking an emotional response. In the middle of it, you find yourself not wanting to turn away or put it down.

#### Diluting the power of stories
That power becomes diluted when we call everything a story. A well-organized dashboard that presents information in a logical order is more analogous to a well-written essay than a good film or novel.

Stories have a logic with continuity and coherence, but logic by itself isn’t a story.

> A visualization isn’t more or less powerful, beautiful, or important because it does or doesn’t tell a story.

Therein lies the problem:   
storytelling is talked about as one of the critical things every data visualization should do.   
It’s part of how we evaluate our work, baked into many models for feedback or judging

> We only care if the insights are interesting and presented in a logical flow.

#### Mostly description, exposition, the rest persuation
I would argue that the overwhelming majority of visualizations I see are descriptions or expositions, with the rest mostly falling into the category of persuasions.
